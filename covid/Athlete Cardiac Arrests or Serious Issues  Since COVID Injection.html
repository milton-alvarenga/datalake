George Garton (25), Sussex County CC Cricket player suffered a bloodclot in his lung after COVID vaccine and a playing trip to Australia where only vaccinated visitors were allowed entry.

Anthony Smith (34), UFC martial arts fighter discovered a blood clot in his leg for which he needed hospital treatment. He blames this clot on the covid vaccine which he got to keep his job despite his mom dying from a booster shot. In September 2021, Smith broke his leg in a fight with Ryal Spann and had surgery on his knee. In July 2022, his mother died 2 weeks after a COVID booster that caused her to have a stroke. It put her into a coma and she died 2 weeks later. In a fight against Ankalaev on 30 July 2022, his leg snapped and he had leg surgery a week later, but then they discovered a blood clot in his leg. The night before he went to UFC Paris, he suffered an anaphylactic reaction. We speculate he got a COVID vaccination around 1st September so he could travel to Paris. Around October 3rd 2022, he said “The night before I went to Paris [for UFC Paris], I had a weird allergic reaction to some meds. … It was a really bad anaphylactic reaction. I was losing my airway, I couldn’t swallow. I was having a tough time breathing. Kind of barely got to the hospital in time before things got too rough. Then after I got back from Paris, they found a blood clot in my leg. So I’ve been battling this blood clot for a while.”&nbsp; <a href="https://www.mmamania.com/2022/10/4/23387875/anthony-smith-details-health-scares-after-leg-injury-maybe-its-just-my-turn-to-struggle-little-bit" target="_blank" rel="noopener">News Story</a>&nbsp; <a href="https://bloodyelbow.com/2022/10/05/getting-f-d-around-every-corner-smith-details-blood-clot-recovery-struggles-ufc-277-injury-mma-news/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">News Story2</a>&nbsp; <a href="https://breakingdigest.com/ufc-fighter-anthony-smith-says-he-developed-blood-clot-post-mrna-covid-vaccine-claims-mother-died-after-pfizer-booster-shot-audio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">News Story3</a>&nbsp; <a href="https://hnmda.nl/nl/complotten-en-samenzweringen/watch-ufc-fighter-anthony-smith-blames-covid-jab-for-blood-clot-says-mother-died-after-pfizer-booster/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">News Story4</a>&nbsp; <a href="https://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2023/07/ufc-fighter-anthony-smith-reveals-he-develops-blood/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">News Story5</a>&nbsp; <a href="https://middleeasy.com/mma-news/anthony-smith-covid-vaccine-to-keep-his-job/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">News Story6</a></li><li>03/10/2022 Massachusetts, USA <span style="color: #ff0000;">Dead</span><br>

Donald Parham (24) Los Angeles Chargers (NFL) tight end player collapsed in mid-air while taking a flying touchdown catch. He had received two Covid-19 vaccines and a booster.

Sander Haugrud (24), Norwegian kickboxing champion in 2019. Two weeks after his second COVID vaccine, stabbing chest pain started, after no previous history of heart problems or any health issues. Diagnosed with pericarditis. Physician at the hospital confirmed it was due to the vaccine. Sander Haugrud: “A couple of weeks after the second dose, I got a sting in my chest that turned out to be heart bag inflammation. I was on surveillance for three days. I have competed nationally and internationally in kickboxing, since the age of 10 to now. But it’s a full stop at training and I don’t know if I can ever train like I did. Now I’m mostly in prison. This might have been avoided, if I had a corona instead, I guess I’d be well by now. It is scary to know that no one mentions anything, I had to dig myself to find information, then I found that there were many cases like mine. At the hospital, doctors had a hard time believing the inflammation was due to the vaccine, but in the end the superior admitted it and said to report it to the Drug Enforcement Administration.”&nbsp; Videointerview in Norwegian: <a href="https://fb.watch/9ONWQbLmHb/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">News Story</a>&nbsp; <a href="https://steigan.no/2022/03/beretninger-etter-vaksinering/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">News Story2</a></li><li>??/02/2021 Sweden<br>
